## Usage

The library exposes the `Turtle` class, which contains all of the functions you need to start drawing.

Start off by creating a turtle.

```
const turtle = new Turtle(0, 0, 1000, 1000);
```

The `Turtle` constructor takes in an initial x-position, initial y-position, canvas height, and canvas width. The default values are 0, 0, 100, 100 respectively.

Take a look at the `demos/` folder to learn how to use your `turtle`.

Have fun!
